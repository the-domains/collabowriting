What if a writer married a gamer?

She'd be attracted to him because he was such a free spirit, could go with the flow, competed, and was so passionate and involved. He'd want to be around her to learn from her structure, her productivity, her education, and her depth.

That's kind of like what happens when two people CollaboWrite.

CollaboWriting is a new app (launching soon) that facilitates two or more people's composition of a story, an article, a letter, or even a full novel.

It has structure, fun, rules, creativity, workarounds, challenges . . . and when you're done, you've co-authored a piece of writing.

How would you like to be a beta tester? More like a beta creator! 450 spots are open for talented, enthusiastic gamers and writers to test, suggest, hack, and create a final version of the CollaboWriting app (and accompanying website). These spots are filling up fast.

Follow this link to be seated as an Original CollaboWriter: oooooo
